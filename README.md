## Modules
### AI Assistant

##### Shortcut
```$ aicoder ai```

This module allows you to communicate with an LLM and if the response had some code, it will opt you to either, (save it, run it, or copy it).

1- A Text Input will show with the title ```Prompt > ```, and this is to allow you to enter your own prompt.
  
  Example:- ``` Prompt > Write a docker compose file with nginx``` 

2- You will see an output like this

```
Language: YAML
Code ------------------------

version: '3'

services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: nginx
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:80
    volumes:
      - ./conf/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
      - ./www:/var/www/html

Do you want to execute this code or save it? r (Run) / s (Save) / c (Copy) / q (quit): 
```
  a. The language parameter shows you the language of the code, and this does not always show up, it may show as ```Language: ```
  b. The Text under the ```Code ----------------``` is the code generated by the LLM
  c. The last this is a question that asks you to run it in the terminal (if it was a bash script, for example), save it, copy it to clipboard.

Hint:- If you want to save it to a project, you can do that under the (Save) option.
